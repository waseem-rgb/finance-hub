# Architecture (Freeze Draft)
Core pillars:
1) Excel upload + mapping templates -> canonical Facts model
2) Placeholders + Adjustments overlays with approvals
3) Hard-coded Ratio Engine (versioned)
4) Role-based premium dashboards
5) AI session memory + RAG over approved financial packs

UAE considerations:
- PDPL + optional DIFC/ADGM mode
- UAE-region hosting + auditability + evidence traceability
